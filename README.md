What is the difference between HolcombeKristjansson_targetFinalCueLocatn.py and HolcombeKristjansson.py

We were about to do some exaggerated version of things.

## Lessons learned

Transient attnetion is hard to get, unless myabe you train Ss for hours

## Working on code, notes

What's determining answer location for answer scoring?
targetOffset indicates what the target should be. targetRing drawn when time for target.

I guess to make target be at the cue destination, I just add to the targetRing orientation however far the cue has travelled.  Maybe don't draw distractors to visualize easily where target is.
