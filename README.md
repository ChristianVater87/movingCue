What is the difference between HolcombeKristjansson_targetFinalCueLocatn.py and HolcombeKristjansson.py

We were about to do some exaggerated version of things.

## Lessons learned

Transient attnetion is hard to get, unless myabe you train Ss for hours

## Working on code, notes

What's determining answer location for answer scoring?
targetOffset indicates what the target should be. targetRing drawn when time for target.

I guess to make target be at the cue destination, I just add to the targetRing orientation however far the cue has travelled.  Maybe don't draw distractors to visualize easily where target is.
Actually the gratings don't seem to be used at all, instead it's a "lines" thing.

* Record origin position, destination position, and brightness in all locations.

* Program task to be either destination position or origin position. And fix auditory feedback.

* If auditory feedback canâ€™t be fixed, add visual feedback message.
