Specific experiments
==============

## Experiment: Concentric vs. peripheral
Is the speed limit the same in the periphery, when not rotating about fixation?
- Use 2 targets, because less cognitive contamination, with different eccentricities so can have an exactly-comparable condition at fixation.
- Downside of 2 targets is that when concentric you can occasionally group them. That will make concentric look better than it should.
- We know the speed limit can't be a blur-limited limit because temporal blurring length is proportional to linear speed, not rps. So in periphery, looks really blurred yet speed limit doesn't go down much. (Ultimately temporal blurring predicts a tf limit but already shown that doesn't hit until 7 Hz, far faster than 2 rps).
- Could do it with 1 target, but then have the eye movements problem and worse blurring problem at 120 Hz. Somewhat mitigated by having both orbits present but only one with a target.
- Have to just use single ring? Although there will always be a confound between crossing hemifields and not. Speed limit could conceivably even have been one of crossing hemifields. Yes, so I'm testing that hypothesis.

## Experiment: Circular speed is the limiting factor

- Adding modulations to the trajectory has little effect, in other words rotational speed is the determinant.  Try square trajectory.

Results
- Critical issue is speed limit of smaller-radius one when not concentric. Smaller one is always ringToQuery=0. Speed limit for me is lower by about 0.4rps.
