- TF and speed limits. Window of tracking diagram
- Demo vimeo.
- Evidence of speed and TF limit - Figure 8
- The effect of load Figure 2 p. 7 and oscillations.
- WTF kind of speed limit is this?
  - Spinzter confirms not refresh artifact (picture p. 10, results p. 11)
  - Not a limit on RFs crossed per unit time.  Off-center, data p.14
  - Diamond versus circle, no apparent effect of straight-line paths
