## Feedback and after-thoughts

- Maybe you track distractors, so number of objects affects that somehow, which explains the 6->9 dip esp. if hard limit -PTG
- Elementary motion detectors are speed-tuned, and there must be a fastest one. Why doesn't that fastest one impose a speed limit?
- Bart talking about expecting it to be spatiotemporal. This is an nice abstract point to address in a review.
- According to Gephstein et al. (2007), the elementary motion TF limit is purely a byproduct of choosing the spatiotemporal combinations optimal for estimating speed. It is not anything inherent to the way motion detectors work.
  - There is therefore no reason to expect that object tracking would be similarly limited, assuming its goal is different from estimating speed but rather to keep attention on an object. However, I could use the perceptual ecology of speeds and show that it does NOT predict the TF limit.  Different optimal model than Vul.
