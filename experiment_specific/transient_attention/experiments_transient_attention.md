 "Screencap of the KNM paper")

- The cue appears (and stays on) `cueLeadTime` before the target iris displaces.
- The eyeballs appear. Shortly after, the iris displaces. Do we ever want the eyeballs on during the cue? 
- Task is to report the iris offset of the cued ball.

Contrast some conditions

- Classic Nakayama & Mackeben. The cue comes on, no motion. Then stimuli come on.
- The cue moves for several hundred ms before it stops and objects then appear.
- Have to be able to test attention both at final destination and at other locations, such as earlier in trajectory.
- Basic condition is for cue to stop cold when target appears, stationary. Also have to try having target appear in motion, cue continuing to move with it.

- Downside: adds temporal uncertainty to when target will appear.
- Downside: endogenous attention may have time to get there, so need to make sure there's really a transient-attention bump there


* Arni: why do the stimuli come on later rather than the eyeball displacing? Well, the eyeball displacement would be a transient that would grab attention.
