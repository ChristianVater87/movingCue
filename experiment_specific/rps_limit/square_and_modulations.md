Circular speed the limiting factor?
==============

## Experiment: Square vs. circle

- Adding modulations to the trajectory has little effect, in other words rotational speed is the determinant.  
- First, blast the annoying speed limit people with a square trajectory. This finally helps answer those interested in linear speed limit
- Compare square trajectory to circular at two eccentricities. Got some data for me with 1 target, but then remembered I'd like to use two targets whenever on center to avoid being blur-limited.

Results
- Critical issue is speed limit of smaller-radius one when not concentric. Smaller one is always ringToQuery=0. Speed limit for me is lower by about 0.4rps.
- Need to run 3 more participants

## Experiment: Modulate radius

- Modulation of radius as function of time. Radius calls function to determine its value at each time.
- Spatial modulation of radius, yielding a radial frequency pattern. Something added to radius as function of angle.

### Theory
- Under pure spatial modulation, distractor traverses same locations as target. At any one time, radius might help distinguish target from distractor. Also if know trajectory, can predict future radius which helps for re-acquisition of target.
- Under pure temporal modulation of radius, can't use radius to distinguish target from distractor. But, distractor can end up 

Should also be a function of time? But if the idea is to know/determine individual objects' trajectories, then reversals will mess it up.
Is it about individual object paths or not?
