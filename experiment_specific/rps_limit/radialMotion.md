On circular versus radial
==============

Circular speed is the only component of motion for which direct support for an effect has been provided. The pseudorandom trajectories typically used in the MOT literature do have a circular component, and they also have a radial component. To many, the notion of decomposing motion into circular and radial components will be unfamiliar. In school we learn to represent a vector, such as a direction of motion, using the Cartesian axes of x (horizontal) and y (vertical). An arbitrary motion direction is then decomposed into its horizontal and vertical components. But the choice of horizontal and vertical is arbitrary. One could equally use circular (the tangent to the circle around the display center) and the radial axis, which is perpendicular to circular.
With the present state of object tracking knowledge, it is sensible to consider the circular and radial components of an objectâ€™s motion. We know that tracking has a circular speed limit, but know nothing about the effect of speed in the radial direction. 

We face two difficulties in studying the effect of speed in the radial direction.
* The distance available to array the objects, while avoiding spatial crowding, is less.
** Spatial crowding is worse in the radial direction
* Unlike for the circular direction, moving an object radially does not eventually bring it back to where it started. For a target that has reached the end of a radial extent, if it is to move radially, it can only move in one direction. Because the participant will likely know that, it makes the tracking task easier.

## Experiment: Modulate radius

- Modulation of radius as function of time. Radius calls function to determine its value at each time.
- Spatial modulation of radius, yielding a radial frequency pattern. Something added to radius as function of angle.

### Theory
- Under pure spatial modulation, distractor traverses same locations as target. At any one time, radius might help distinguish target from distractor. Also if know trajectory, can predict future radius which helps for re-acquisition of target.
- Under pure temporal modulation of radius, can't use radius to distinguish target from distractor. But, distractor can end up 

Should also be a function of time? But if the idea is to know/determine individual objects' trajectories, then reversals will mess it up.
Is it about individual object paths or not?
