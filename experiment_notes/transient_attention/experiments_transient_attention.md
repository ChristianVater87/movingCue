- The cue comes on and stays on, and shortly after the iris offsets.
- Task is to report the iris offset of the cued ball.
- Contrast some conditions
  - The cue comes on, no motion.
  - The cue moves for several hundred ms before it stops. 
   - Downside: adds temporal uncertainty to when target will appear.
   - Downside: endogenous attention may have time to get there, so need to make sure there's really a transient-attention bump there
